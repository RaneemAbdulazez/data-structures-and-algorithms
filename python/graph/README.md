# Graphs
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. 
## Challenge
The challenge is to implement a graph with the methods : 
add node
add edge
get nodes
get neighbors
size
## Approach & Efficiency
Big O(n)
